üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
To get this project running locally, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+, Maven, and Docker & Docker Compose installed.

Clone the Repository:
Navigate to your desired directory and clone the project.

Database Setup:
The project uses PostgreSQL, configured via a docker-compose.yml file. Start the database container using docker-compose up -d. This will set up a bank_db database with default credentials.

Configure Spring Boot:
Update src/main/resources/application.properties with your database connection details (matching the Docker Compose setup). Ensure spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto is set appropriately for schema management.

Build and Run:
From the project root, build the application with mvn clean install and then run it using mvn spring-boot:run. The application will start on http://localhost:8080.
